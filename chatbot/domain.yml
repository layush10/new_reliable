When a fact that affects the policy issuance decision is not disclosed in the proposal, it is termed as 'non-disclosure'. Similarly, withholding information or providing incorrect information while answering questions in the proposal form is termed as, 'misstatement'.
            For example, when an applicant suffering from kidney failure does not inform the insurer about the same in the proposal form, it is termed as non-disclosure. Similarly, when an applicant overstates his or her income, then it is called a misstatement.
